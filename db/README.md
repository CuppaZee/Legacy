# Munzee Database

When making a change to the Munzee Database, please run `node index.js` before committing. This will compile the database JSON files and copy them to the PaperZee and FlameZee projects.

Documentation on the Database will be coming in the future.

## Points Examples

The `points` variable can be either a Points object (see below) or a String (eg. `"card_limited"` or `"myth"`) which related to a specific Points Category in `points.json`

If at least 3 similar types use the same points structure, it is recommended that you create a new Points category in `points.json` and link to that instead.

When contributing to the Points values, please do not put points information for the following types:
- Bouncers
- Bouncer Hosts
- Greetings Cards
- Anything with Points Structure Types which are not listed below (eg. Destinations)
